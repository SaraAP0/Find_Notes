Test cases

Testing is based on the analysis of the outputs generated by the system or its components in response to specific inputs defined on the basis of the sole knowledge of the requirements specified for the system or its components. They are tested:

 - External functionalities: functionalities visible to the user and defined by requirements and specifications (e.g. use cases)

-  Internal features: features not visible to the user and defined by the high and low level project
Starting from the specifications of the features / use cases: input data, output data, preconditions, postconditions, scenarios, processing.

Necessary condition for carrying out a test: knowing the expected behavior, to be compared with that observed with the execution of the software, in order to define the oracle.
The oracle specifies the expected behavior for each test case.

Oracle:

- human: based on specification or judgment

- automatic: generated by the (formal) specifications;





























Use Case	Request permission
	Equivalence classes	
Input	Valid classes	Invalid classes
Yes button	C1 = Button “Yes” pressed 	C2 = Button “No” pressed
C3 = Application closed or in background
No button	C4 = Button “No” pressed
C5 = Application closed or in background	C6 = Button “Yes” pressed

ID	Input	Value	Covered classes	Expected output	Observed output	Outcome
#1	Yes button	“Yes”	C1	Next activity started	Next activity started	positive
	No button	“No”	C4	Application is not working correctly	Application is not working correctly	

#2	Yes button	“No”	C2	Application is not working correctly	Application is not working correctly”	positive
	No button	“Yes”	C6	Next activity started	Next activity started
